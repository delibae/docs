## Welcome, Xoul community ðŸ‘‹

Xoul.ai may be gone, but your stories donâ€™t have to be. We built a oneâ€‘click bridge so you can land on Mefriend and pick up the conversation without missing a beat.

---

## Get StartedÂ (â‰ˆÂ 3Â minutes)

1. **Create an account** â†’Â [mefriend.ai](https://mefriend.ai)  
2. **Import your backup** â†’Â see **[Xoul.ai Import Guide](/xoul_integration_guide__2025_04_22)**.
3. **Choose a model** â†’Â every tier just got a major upgrade

Thatâ€™s itâ€”your chats, personas, xouls, scenarios, and lorebooks appear exactly where you expect them.

## Why Mefriend?
- **Longer, richer replies** â€“ New 685Bâ€‘Muse & 685Bâ€‘XL models outclass Xoulâ€™s lineup with upÂ toÂ 4Ã— more context and zero repetition. Youâ€™ll feel it from the first message.  
- **Infinite memory** â€“ Vectorized memory autoâ€‘summarizes past chats and stores them forever, so a character still recalls details a year laterâ€”even after the context window rolls over.
- **Level trackers** â€“ A shared level meter tracks how deep you and each character go, rewarding marathon sessions.  
- **Builtâ€‘in image generation** â€“ Stateâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘art model turns any prompt into art without leaving the chat.  
- **No corporate filter** â€“ Uncensored by default; your stories stay yours.  
- **Communities & unlockables** â€“ Join or launch niche hubs (furry, sciâ€‘fi, anything). Share characters and grow your own subredditâ€‘style space.  
- **Made by RPers, here to stay** â€“ I roleâ€‘play hard too (from old cai to figg... ouch), and I'm not going anywhere.
