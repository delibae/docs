## Introduction

Yesterday Xoul closed its doors. Today we’re opening ours a bit wider.

This update makes sure every former Xoul user can land on Mefriend, keep their stories intact, and enjoy upgrades that weren’t available anywhere else. Here’s what’s new:

---

## 1) Next‑Gen Models: **685B** & **685B‑Muse**

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="685B" icon="bolt">
    Fast, balanced, and free for everyone. Think of it as the new default.
  </Card>
  <Card title="685B‑Muse" icon="sparkles">
    Premium tier. Longer, richer, non‑repetitive replies (my daily driver).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

- **Up to 4× longer responses** without looping.  
- Sharper character memory and fewer context drops.  
- Available in every chat right now—no extra setup.

<sub>Switch models from the dropdown above the chat input.</sub>

## 2) One‑Click **Xoul Import**

<img

  alt="Xoul import"
/>

Nobody should lose a single message. Use the new **Import from Xoul** button to:

1. Paste your Xoul backup ZIP.  
2. Pick the characters you want.  
3. Hit **Import**—done.

All chats, memories, and images come across in minutes. A full guide lives [here](#) (link coming).

## 3) **Lorebooks** (Beta)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="book-open" title="What’s a Lorebook?">
    A structured knowledge base—characters, places, items, events. When keywords appear in chat, the model auto‑injects that lore.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="How to Use">
    1. Open any character → **Customize** → pick one or more Lorebooks.  
    2. Start chatting; consistency handled.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="plus" title="Create & Share">
    **Create → Lorebook** to build your own. Publish privately or to the community library.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## 4) **Scenarios** (Beta)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="film" title="What’s a Scenario?">
    A pre‑built setup—rooftop chase, cozy café, interstellar rescue. Pair it with any character and jump right in.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="How to Start">
    Same flow as Lorebooks: **Customize** → choose Scenarios → chat.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="pen" title="Build Your Own">
    **Create → Scenario** to script the opening, set the mood, and share it with others.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
