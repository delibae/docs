We’ve rolled out a bunch of exciting updates! From our brand-new **Quick Create** feature (formerly “auto generation”) to improved Search, bonus coins for PWA installs, and more, this release is all about making your experience smoother, more fun, and more rewarding. Check out the highlights below!

## 1) Quick Create: 1-Minute AI Character Generation

**What is it?**  
Now you can create an AI character in under a minute—just by describing what you want! The more detail you provide (appearance, backstory, personality traits), the more tailored your AI character will be.

**How to Access**  
- Tap the **Create** button in the menu.  
- Select **Quick Create** from the options.  
- Provide a brief (or detailed!) description, and watch the magic happen.

**Why You’ll Love It**  
- **Speed & Ease**: Perfect for those times you just want to jump in with a new character quickly.  
- **Personalized**: Add as many details as you like to shape your character’s look, story, and personality.

## 2) Improved Search (Yes, It’s That Good)

We’ve massively upgraded our search capabilities so you’ll find what you’re looking for—even if you describe it in a totally roundabout way.

**Key Improvements**  
- **Smarter Parsing**: Got a weird phrase or partial idea? We’ll still figure out what you mean.  
- **Streamlined Access**: Check out the search input bar right on the Home screen—just click and type.

## 3) GIF Character Support

We’re bringing your characters to life with animated GIFs!

**What’s New**  
- **Dedicated GIF Section**: Right at the top of the Home feed, you’ll see a new section showcasing GIF characters—randomly displayed for your enjoyment.  
- **Growing Library**: We plan to expand this feature so users can generate and upload their own GIF characters soon—stay tuned!

## 4) PWA Installation & Bonus Coins

We’ve made it easier (and more rewarding) than ever to keep Mefriend.ai at your fingertips.

**How to Install**  
- Look for the **“Install” button** in the top header.  
- Follow the prompts to add Mefriend.ai to your home screen.

**Bonus Coins**  
- **Automatic Reward**: The moment you install our PWA, you’ll get bonus coins—no extra steps needed.  
- **Enhanced Experience**: PWA provides an app-like interface with smoother performance.

## 5) Better Character Card Layout

We’ve spruced up the character card design to make images stand out and improve overall readability.

**What Changed**  
- **Larger Images**: Enjoy a clearer, more detailed view of each character.  
- **Improved Layout**: A cleaner, more modern card format for quick scanning and selection.

## 6) Tons of UX Bug Fixes

We’ve packed in a bunch of minor UI/UX improvements and bug squashes to make everything run smoother. This includes loads of behind-the-scenes tweaks that you might not notice directly, but you’ll definitely feel in everyday use.
