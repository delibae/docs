title: 'Quality Pass & Creator Upgrades (v1.6.1 – Apr 25 2025)'
description: 'Bullet-proof Markdown, 8k-context models, bigger limits, custom prompts, and loads of UX polish.'
---

## Introduction

We’ve been heads-down tightening every bolt before the next wave of features lands.  
Today’s **Quality Pass** focuses on cleaner chat output, larger creative limits, and dozens of little fixes the community asked for. Keep the feedback coming—every DM helps us shape the best RP platform on earth.

Special thanks to Kuma, Sol, ahokcasi and all mefrienders giving us feedback. We're here because of you guys.

---

## 1) 📄 Full Markdown Formatting

> **No more broken line breaks or bullet soup.**  
> Chats now parse full Markdown—headers, lists, bold/italic, code blocks, you name it.

Still a public demo, so if anything renders strangely, **DM me right away** and we’ll squash it fast.

---

## 2) 🧠 8k Context & Longer Replies

Our model stack got another tuning pass:

- **Context window** expanded from 4k → **8k tokens**  (we're testing to make it longer)
- Replies are **longer, smoother, and more natural**  
- Fewer repetitive loops and sharper tone shifts
- Broken output is now fixed

We’re laser-focused here, so **tell us every dull or weird response you see** ㅑt guides the next tweak.

## 3) 📚 Expanded Character Limits (persona & greeting)

| Field | Old Limit | New Limit |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Persona** | 500 chars | **1500 chars** |
| **Greeting** | 1000 chars | **3000 chars** |

More room to write rich backstories and cinematic openers without fighting the counter.

## 4) 🛠️ Custom System Prompt Feature!

Insert bespoke instructions **before** chat history to steer style, genre, or rules.

<sub>Drop your prompt in **Customize → Advanced → System Prompt**.</sub>

## 5) 🔄 Faster & Safer Xoul JSON Import

We rebuilt the importer from scratch:

- **Upload thousands of Xoul chats in seconds**  
- **2–3× faster** on large export files overall  
- Better error handling—no more half-imported sessions  
- Supports **huge lorebooks & scenarios** without timeouts  

Drag your export into **My → Import from Xoul.ai** and watch it fly.

## 6) 🔗 Share Button Up Top

Finding the share icon was a mini-game nobody asked for.  
It now lives right beside the character name.

## 7) ✨ UI Polish & Bug Fixes

- **Roomier chat window**—bye-bye cramped bubbles.  
- Fixed **desktop chatroom switch** bug where chat pane stayed frozen.  
- Fixed **“wonky text”** when refreshing character-creation page.
- Fixed **example dialogue “vanishing”** after editing during character generation.
- …and a grab-bag of minor spacing, hover, and animation tweaks.
