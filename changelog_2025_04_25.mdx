## Introduction

We’ve been heads-down tightening every bolt before the next wave of features lands.  
Today’s **Quality Pass** focuses on cleaner chat output, larger creative limits, and dozens of little fixes the community asked for. Keep the feedback coming—every DM helps us shape the best RP platform on earth.

---

## 1) 📄 Full Markdown Formatting

> **No more broken line breaks or bullet soup.**  
> Chats now parse full Markdown—headers, lists, bold/italic, code blocks, you name it.

Still a public demo, so if anything renders strangely, **DM me right away** and we’ll squash it fast.

---

## 2) 🧠 8k Context & Longer Replies

Our model stack got another tuning pass:

- **Context window** expanded from 4 k → **8 k tokens**  
- Replies are **longer, smoother, and more natural**  
- Fewer repetitive loops and sharper tone shifts

We’re laser-focused here, so **tell us every dull or weird response you see**—it guides the next tweak.

---

## 3) 📚 Expanded Character Limits (persona & greeting)

| Field | Old Limit | New Limit |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Persona** | 500 chars | **1 500 chars** |
| **Greeting** | 1 000 chars | **3 000 chars** |

More room to write rich backstories and cinematic openers without fighting the counter.

## 4) 🛠️ Custom System Prompt Feature!

Insert bespoke instructions **before** chat history to steer style, genre, or rules.

<sub>Drop your prompt in **Customize → Advanced → System Prompt**. Screenshot space reserved.</sub>

---

## 5) 🔄 Faster & Safer Xoul JSON Import

We rebuilt the importer from scratch:

- **Upload thousands of Xoul chats in seconds**  
- **2–3× faster** on large export files overall  
- Better error handling—no more half-imported sessions  
- Supports **huge lorebooks & scenarios** without timeouts  
- Clear progress bar so you always know where you are

Drag your export into **My → Import from Xoul.ai** and watch it fly.

## 6) 🔗 Share Button Up Top

Finding the share icon was a mini-game nobody asked for.  
It now lives right beside the character name.

## 7) ✨ UI Polish & Bug Fixes

- **Roomier chat window**—bye-bye cramped bubbles.  
- Fixed **desktop tab-switch** bug where chat pane stayed frozen.  
- Fixed **“wonky text”** when refreshing character-creation page.  
- Fixed **example dialogue “vanishing”** after editing during character generation.  
- …and a grab-bag of minor spacing, hover, and animation tweaks.

## What’s Next?

We’re far from done—next up are **multimedia replies**, **lorebook-scenario bundles**, and **ad-watch coin boosts**. Got an idea? Caught a glitch? **DM me anytime.**
