A bigger canvas, sharper tools, and fewer roadblocks.  
Build characters by *talking*, start every chat on the right note, and
zero-in on the worlds you actually want to see. Let’s unpack the highlights. 🚀

## 1) 🧠 Character Builder : Chat to create a character!

1. **Create → Character Builder**  
2. Chat with the bot until your persona feels *just right*
3. **Finalize the Character**—done.

## 2) 💬 Tired of awkward first messages? Meet Dynamic Greetings

<Check>Goodbye awkward openers—every “hello” fits the vibe.</Check>
 
We’ve all been there — cool character, bad first line. Now, you can generate a personalized greeting that matches your tone.
When building a character, just turn on the Dynamic Greeting toggle (only available for eligible characters).
Everyone gets one free — Prime users get unlimited. No more weird convos. Start smooth.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Creator Toggle" icon="toggle-on">
    New characters: **ON** by default.  
    Existing ones: flip the switch when you’re ready.

    One free dynamic greeting **per character**.  
    Prime & above: unlimited spontaneity.

## 3) 🎨 More Image Models, More Magic

We've expanded from one image model to four, giving you a vastly more powerful and versatile artistic toolkit to bring your characters to life visually.

*prefect-pony · prefect-illustrious · prefect-illustrious (handsome) · animagine*

<Check>All tiers, same playground—just use coins.</Check>

* Mix & match artist tags, positive / negative prompts, scale sliders.  
* More bases (LoRA, schedulers, detailers) are queued—tell us what you need next!

(Currently available inside Character Generation.)

## 4) ✍️  Create Page 2.0

Now it's easier to express your character and yourself.
We cleaned up the layout into three clear steps: Character Definition / First Message / Advanced

You’ll also find:
* ✨ Help Me Write — auto-generates your first message using the character name & greeting.
* 📌 Macro buttons like "{{user}}" and "{{char}}" to speed things up.
* ✍️ Creator's Comment: “Say anything you like. Describe the character, share chat tips, or leave a backstory notes.” Use this new field to connect with users.


<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="✨ Help Me Write" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Auto-craft the first message from name + greeting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="{{user}} & {{char}}" icon="bolt">
    One-tap macros for faster prompt building.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## 5) 🔍  Explore Smarter, Find Faster

Characters, Scenarios, Lorebooks — now all neatly organized and easier to browse.

<Check>Browse Characters, Scenarios, and Lorebooks in one streamlined flow.</Check>

* Four clear categories: **Romance · Slice of Life · Adventure & RPG · Assistant & Utility**, each category has detailed tags.
* Tag filters—plus **Hide Tag** to banish content you dislike (saved to your account).  
* Tap **Filter** on the Home screen to flip between asset types. *(Screenshot here ➜)*

## 6) 🔔  In-App Notifications

You'll now receive notifications for user activity on characters you've created, as well as important platform news like update notes and daily recaps, all in one central notifications page.

    See when others chat with your characters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Daily Recap" icon="calendar-check">
