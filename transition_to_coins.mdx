title: 'Transitioning from Subscriptions to Coins'
description: 'Important information about our new coin-based billing system (Feb. 24th, 2025)'

## Overview

Hey there! Thank you for being part of our AI community. We’ve been observing how people use our service, and it turns out many of you want more control over when and how you’re billed. After lots of thought (and coffee!), we’ve decided to switch from a traditional subscription model to a coin-based system.

Our main goal in this transition is to give you more flexibility and potentially save you money in the long run.

## Moving On From Subscriptions

Rather than monthly fees, you’ll now buy coins that you spend whenever you chat or create things via our AI characters. If you’re super active, you can stock up on more coins. If you’re taking a break, you won’t be billed for something you’re not using. This is our way of making sure you only pay for what you actually use.

<Note>
We appreciate each and every subscriber who’s supported us so far. This transition isn’t about dismissing you—quite the opposite! We want to ensure you have a flexible and sustainable way to engage with our AI characters moving forward.

## How Coins Work

    Each coin is priced at **$0.015**.

    You only spend coins when you actually use our AI characters—no hidden or ongoing monthly fees.

## Subscription Balances & Conversions

We’ll automatically convert your remaining subscription balance into coins at a 1:1 ratio (for example, \$5 becomes 334 coins). As a **thank-you** for your early support, you’ll also receive bonus coins based on your plan:

- **Monthly subscription:** +10% extra coins  
- **6-Month subscription:** +20% extra coins  
- **1-Year subscription:** +30% extra coins  

<Example>
**Example Calculation**  
- You have a monthly subscription costing \$10/month, and you’re halfway through the month.  
- That’s about \$5 worth of unused subscription value.  
- Converting \$5 → 334 coins, plus a 10% bonus (34 coins).  
- You end up with **368 coins** total.
</Example>

<Alert title="Prefer a Refund?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  If coin conversion doesn’t feel right for you, no worries! You can request a refund for any unused portion of your subscription at any time—no questions asked.
</Alert>

## Next Steps

1. **When You Log In:** A pop-up will ask if you’d like to convert your subscription into coins. If you say yes, the coins are yours instantly. If you say no, we’ll guide you through requesting a refund.  
2. **No Pressure: 3-Month Grace Period:** You have 1 month to decide whether you’d like to convert your subscription into coins or request a refund. We’ll send you reminders along the way, so you won’t miss your chance to make a choice. If we don’t hear from you by the end of the month, we’ll automatically convert your remaining subscription balance into coins.

## A Quick Q&A

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Do my coins expire?">
Currently, no. They’re yours to keep indefinitely. If we ever change our policy, we'll give you plenty of notice.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="bolt" title="What if I need more coins?">
You can purchase additional coins any time inside the app, whenever you like.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="comments" title="What happens to my chat history?">
Nothing changes. All your past conversations and content will remain exactly where they are.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="life-ring" title="Am I forced to convert?">
Nope. If you prefer to request a refund instead, that’s completely up to you. We want you to feel comfortable with whichever choice you make.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="life-ring" title="What if I do nothing and don’t respond within the 1-month grace period?">
If we haven’t heard from you by the end of the 30-day grace period, we’ll automatically convert your remaining subscription balance into coins. Don’t worry—we’ll send you reminders so you have multiple chances to make your choice. If you come back after the conversion but haven’t used any coins yet, you can still request a refund by contacting our support team.
