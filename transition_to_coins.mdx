title: 'Transitioning from Subscriptions to Coins'
description: 'Important information about our new coin-based billing system'

## Overview

**Hey there!** Thanks for being part of our AI community. We’ve been watching how people actually use our service, and it turns out many of you want more control over when and how you’re billed. After lots of thought (and coffee!), we’ve decided to switch from a traditional subscription model to a coin-based system.

Our main goal? To give you more flexibility and potentially save you money in the long run.

## What’s Changing

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Bye-Bye Subscriptions" icon="xmark">
    <p>
      Instead of monthly fees, you’ll now buy coins that you spend whenever you chat or create things via our AI characters.
      If you’re super active, you can stock up on more coins. If you’re taking a break, you won’t be billed for something
      you’re not using.
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Value of a Coin" icon="coins">
    <p>
      Each coin is priced at <strong>$0.01</strong> (so 100 coins = $1). Pretty straightforward, right?
    </p>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  <strong>Flexible Use:</strong> With this model, you only spend coins when you actually use our AI characters—no hidden or recurring charges.
</Note>

## Subscription Balances & Conversions

If you have any remaining subscription balance, we’ll automatically convert it into coins. We’re also adding bonus coins as a thank-you for trusting us early on:

<List type="check">
  <li><strong>Monthly subscription:</strong> +10% extra coins</li>
  <li><strong>6-Month subscription:</strong> +20% extra coins</li>
  <li><strong>1-Year subscription:</strong> +30% extra coins</li>
</List>

<Alert title="Prefer a Refund?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  If coin conversion doesn’t feel right for you, no worries! You can request a refund for any unused portion of your subscription at any time—no questions asked.
</Alert>

## Next Steps

1. **When You Log In**: A pop-up will ask if you’d like to convert your subscription into coins. If you say yes, the coins are yours instantly. If no, we’ll guide you through requesting a refund.
2. **No Pressure, No Deadline**: Take your time deciding; we won’t rush you. Whenever you’re ready, we’re here to help.
