  | **Max Tokens**        | 1&nbsp;‚Äì&nbsp;700                                        | The cap on tokens in the model's response. Higher ‚Üí longer replies (and more cost). |

## 2) üîç Preview Mode & Draft System

Quality control just got a major upgrade! Test your characters before publishing and perfect them with our new preview and draft system.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/changelog/2025_05_28/preview_1.png" alt="Preview Mode Interface" />
</div>


### Enhanced Creation Workflow:
- **Save as Draft**: Work on characters without publishing immediately
- **Preview Testing**: Chat with your character during creation. It doesn't cost any coins, so you can test as much as you want!
- **Draft Management**: Access all your drafts from "Create from Draft"
  <div align="center">
    <img src="/images/changelog/2025_05_28/draft_1.png" alt="Draft Management" width="300" />
  </div>

- **Preset Integration**: Test different presets to find the perfect setup
- **Auto-Save Protection**: Never lose your work again! If you accidentally close the browser or navigate away without saving to draft or publishing, your character progress is automatically preserved in "Drafts" for seamless recovery
  <div align="center">
    <img src="/images/changelog/2025_05_28/draft_2.png" alt="Draft Management" width="300" />
  </div>

### Why This Matters:
- **Quality Assurance**: Catch issues before your character goes live
- **Iterative Design**: Refine personality and responses through testing
- **Confidence**: Publish knowing your character performs exactly as intended

No more publishing and hoping for the best‚Äînow you can perfect every detail first!

## 3) üìö Advanced Lorebook Controls

Lorebooks just got more powerful with **Insertion Depth** control, giving you precise control over when and how lore activates. 
When you create a lorebook entry, you can now choose how deep the lore should be inserted into the prompt.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/changelog/2025_05_28/lorebook_1.png" alt="Lorebook Insertion Depth Settings" width="300"/>
</div>

### New Lorebook Features:
- **Insertion Depth**: Control exactly where lorebook content appears in the prompt
- **Better Performance**: More efficient lorebook processing
- **Enhanced Scanning**: Improved keyword detection and activation

<Info>
  **Pro Tip**: Use shallow insertion depths for immediate context and deeper depths for background lore that should influence the entire conversation.
</Info>

## 4) üñºÔ∏è Character Wallpapers

Set custom wallpapers for your characters when you create your character! When users start a chat with your character, your selected wallpaper will automatically be applied to create the perfect atmosphere.

### Features:
- **Automatic Setup**: If you set a wallpaper to your character, all chatrooms with that character will automatically have the wallpaper applied
- **Immersive Experience**: Match visuals to your character's world
- **Creator Control**: Set the mood before the first message

## 5) üîÑ Streamlined Chatroom Interface

We've reorganized the chatroom UI to work seamlessly with the new preset system, making everything more intuitive and accessible.

### What's Changed:
- **Model Selection Moved**: Find model switching in the **right menu** within chatrooms
- **System Prompts Integrated**: Custom system prompts are now part of presets for better organization
- **Automatic Migration**: Your existing custom system prompts have been automatically converted to presets

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/changelog/2025_05_28/chatroom_1.png" alt="Chatroom Interface" width="800"/>
</div>

<Warning>
  Don't worry about losing your custom prompts! Check "My Settings" to find presets like "Your preset for [character name]" containing all your previous custom system prompts.
</Warning>

This reorganization makes the interface cleaner while ensuring all your personalized settings are preserved and easily accessible through the preset system.
