## Introduction

Xoul.ai closed its doors yesterday. We pulled an all‑nighter (fueled by way too much coffee ☕) to ship a one‑drag importer so you don’t lose a single memory. Follow the steps below and you’ll be role‑playing again in minutes.

## Before You Start

<Alert type="info" title="Already exported your Xoul data?">
This guide assumes you’ve downloaded the Xoul export zip.  
If you haven’t, try logging in at **xoul.ai** to request an export.  
If the site is offline, email their support.
</Alert>

**What you can import today**

| ✅ Available now | ⏳ Coming soon |
| --- | --- |
| Single‑user chats (`chats_single`) | Group‑chats (ETA ≈ 2‑3 weeks) |
| Personas you created (`personas`) | |
| Xouls you created (`xouls`) | |

---

## 1) Unzip Your Xoul Export

![Unzipped folders](/images/docs/import_xoul/unzip.png)

After unzipping, you should see up to three folders:

| Folder | What’s inside |
| --- | --- |
| `chats_single` | One‑on‑one conversations |
| `personas` | Your custom characters |
| `xouls` | Your published xouls |

If you never used a feature (e.g., personas), that folder may be missing—no problem.

## 2) Sign Up (or Log In) to Mefriend

Create an account or log in, then head to **My → Import from Xoul.ai**.

## 3) Drag & Drop Your Files

<img className="block" src="/images/docs/import_xoul/dropzones.png" alt="Dropzones" />

1. **Chats** → drop the entire **`chats_single`** folder.  
2. **Personas** → drop the **`personas`** folder.  
3. **Xouls** → drop the **`xouls`** folder.  

Click **Upload** when you’re ready. Processing usually finishes in under a minute.

---

## 4) Verify Your Import

- **Chats** → open your **Chats** page. Your old conversations should pick up exactly where you left off.  
- **Personas / Xouls** → visit **My Characters**. Imported items default to **Public**—switch them to **Private** if you prefer.
