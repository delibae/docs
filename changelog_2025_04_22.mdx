## Introduction

Xoul.ai closed its doors yesterday. We pulled an all‑nighter (fueled by way too much coffee ☕) to ship a one‑drag importer so you don’t lose a single memory. Follow the steps below and you’ll be role‑playing again in minutes.

## Before You Start

<Note>
This guide assumes you’ve downloaded the Xoul export zip.  
If you haven’t, try logging in at **xoul.ai** to request an export.  
If the site is offline, email their support.
</Note>

### What you can import today
- **One‑on‑one chats** (`chats_single`) – every DM drops straight into your chat list, ready to continue. 
- **Personas you created** (`personas`) – your persona appear in *persona page* so you can chat or tweak them instantly
- **Xouls you created** (`xouls`)

*Group‑chat imports are next in the queue (give us about two weeks).*

## 1) Unzip Your Xoul Export

![Unzipped folders](/images/docs/import_xoul/unzip.png)

After unzipping, you should see up to three folders:

| Folder | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `chats_single` | Your private conversations |
| `personas` | Characters you built |
| `xouls` | Xouls you published |

No worries if you're missing a folder. That just means you never used that feature.

## 2) Sign Up (or Log In) to Mefriend

Create an account or log in to [mefriend.ai](https://mefriend.ai), then head to **My → Import from Xoul.ai**.

## 3) Drag & Drop Your Files

1. **Chats** → drop the entire **`chats_single`** folder.  
2. **Personas** → drop the **`personas`** folder.  
3. **Xouls** → drop the **`xouls`** folder.  

Click **Upload** when you’re ready. Processing usually finishes in under a minute.

## 4) Verify Your Import

- **Chats** → open your **Chats** page. Your old conversations should pick up exactly where you left off.  
- **Personas / Xouls** → visit **My Characters**. Imported items default to **Public**—switch them to **Private** if you prefer.
