## What is "Creator"?

A **creator** on mefriend.ai is a user who crafts AI characters for others to interact with. Creators gain access to special dashboards, metrics, and (soon) monetization tools. Whether you‚Äôre designing story-driven personalities or fun role-play companions, the Creator Club is here to support and spotlight your work.

## The Creator Dashboard

The Creator Dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of your impact on mefriend.ai. You can see:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Interactions" icon="arrow-pointer">
    Total user actions (likes, comments, chats) across your published AI characters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Subscribers" icon="users">
    Number of users who follow your characters.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating Characters

Creators currently share the same interface as regular users, but more powerful tools are on the horizon! We plan to introduce advanced editor tools, allowing you to customize behaviors, set deeper personalities, and refine prompts with ease‚Äîeverything to help your AI characters stand out.
